## 1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :- 

Objective: The project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions using machine learning techniques.

Dataset: The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This dataset is commonly used for introductory machine learning tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating classification algorithms.

Model Training: The classifier is trained using the Iris dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the features and target classes. Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines can be employed for this task.

Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set. This high accuracy indicates that the model is effective in classifying iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal dimensions
