## 1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION :- 

Objective: The project aims to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal dimensions using machine learning techniques.

Dataset: The project utilizes the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This dataset is commonly used for introductory machine learning tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating classification algorithms.

Model Training: The classifier is trained using the Iris dataset to learn patterns and relationships between the features and target classes. Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines can be employed for this task.

Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 97% on the test set. This high accuracy indicates that the model is effective in classifying iris flowers into their respective species based on their sepal and petal dimensions

### 2.UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON :- 

Objective: The project aims to analyze unemployment trends using Python, focusing on historical unemployment data. By utilizing data analysis and visualization techniques, the project seeks to uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing unemployment rates.

Dataset: The project utilizes publicly available datasets containing historical unemployment data. These datasets include information such as unemployment rates, and relevant factors.

Result: One notable finding from the analysis is that the unemployment rate was significantly higher in the northern region compared to other areas. This insight suggests potential socioeconomic factors or regional disparities that may be contributing to higher unemployment rates in that specific region.

#### 3. EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING :-

Objective: Email spam, or junk mail, is a pervasive issue that affects users worldwide. This project addresses the challenge of identifying and filtering spam emails using machine learning. By training a classifier on a dataset of labeled emails, the project aims to distinguish between legitimate and spam emails automatically.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing a collection of labeled emails, where each email is classified as spam or non-spam (ham). This dataset serves as the training and testing data for the machine learning model.

Results
The trained spam detector achieved the following accuracies:
1. Accuracy on training data: 96.61%
2. Accuracy on test data: 96.23%
These results indicate that the model performs well in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

##### 4. SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON :-

Objective: The aim of this project is to predict sales based on advertising expenditure using the given dataset. The dataset contains information about advertising spending on different platforms (TV, Radio, and Newspaper) and the corresponding sales amount.

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset containing historical sales data, including information such as sales figures, time periods, marketing efforts, economic indicators, and other relevant features.

Result: We can say that above mention solution is successfully able to predict the sales using advertising platform datasets.
